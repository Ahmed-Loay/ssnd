# SSND - Simple Stupid Notification Daemon
A lightweight semi-complaint notification daemon according to [the freedesktop.org spec](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/notification-spec/latest/protocol.html), perfect for scripting needs.

---

## Motivation
Found a lack of non-UI based notification daemons that provide the means for scripts to read and act upon user notifications.

## Features
* Raw and JSON output formats
* Trivial to use with scripts ;)
